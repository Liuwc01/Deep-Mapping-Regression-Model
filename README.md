code and file for "C-DONN: compact diffractive optical neural network with deep learning regression"
1. ComplexPyTorch folder is the Library essential for the network
2. complex_fitting_50.py is the ket code for training: you can change the parameters and your training goal here
3. model.py and modelpred.py is the prediction code
4. matpy.m is the matlab-python interface
5. test.m is the testing code
6. test_data.mat is 20 samples for testing  
# here we offer a basic weight file in release, for further research and different mission, please train your own net by the method in the paper.
